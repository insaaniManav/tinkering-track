# Electronics Workshop Safety Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to The Tinkering space! Our main rule is to stay safe while having fun. We're working with small electronic stuff that won't blow up, but we still need to be careful.

## General Safety Tips

- **Adults Around**: Always have a grown-up or teacher with you.

- **Clean Area**: Keep your space neat and tidy so you don't trip or lose things.

- **No Food or Drinks**: Don't eat or drink while working with electronics.

- **Clean Hands**: Wash your hands before and after touching the electronics.

- **Static Electricity**: Touch something metal before handling electronics to avoid shocking them.

- **Safety Glasses**: Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes, especially when using hot tools.

## Electrical Safety

- **Low Voltage**: We're using a small amount of electricity (5V), but always be careful

- **Unplug**: Always unplug things before plugging them in or taking them apart.

- **Check Stuff**: Look at things closely before using them. Don't use anything broken.

- **Watch How You Connect**: Be sure to connect things the right way. Mixing it up can hurt the stuff. Make sure to connect wires according to the diagram that has been made 

## Avoiding Short Circuits

- **What's a Short Circuit?**: A short circuit happens when 5v and ground wires touch each other , it leads to a path where the resistance is very low, this can lead to component damage

- **Stay Apart**: Make sure wires don't touch when they shouldn't.

- **Use Tape**: If wires are exposed, put tape on them to cover them up.

- **Keep Metal Away**: Don't let metal stuff near the electronics.

## Handling Batteries

- **Battery Care**: Be gentle with batteries. They can leak or break.

- **Put Them Right**: Make sure the + and - signs on batteries match up with what's in the gadget.

- **Store Well**: Keep batteries in a cool, dry place, and don't let them get too hot or cold.

## Conclusion

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes as you learn. Nothing bad will happen with our small 5V electronics, but we still want to be safe. If you're not sure about something, ask questions, and have fun exploring the world of electronics and programming!
