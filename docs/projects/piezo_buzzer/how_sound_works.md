# What is sound

## Waves
Waves are a bit like ripples in a pond when you throw a stone into the water. They're a way that energy travels from one place to another. But instead of water, waves can happen in lots of different things, like air, water, or even light!

Imagine you're playing with a jump rope. When you wiggle one end up and down, you make a wave travel along the rope. This wave moves from one end to the other. Waves in nature work similarly, except they don't need a rope â€“ they can move through different materials.

## Wavelength
Now, let's talk about wavelength. It's like measuring the distance between the ripples in the pond or the bumps in the jump rope. Imagine you're making waves in the water with your hand. If you make big waves, the distance between each wave (the wavelength) is longer. If you make tiny ripples, the wavelength is shorter.

In other words, wavelength is how long one wave is from start to finish. It's like measuring the length of one cycle of the wave.

## Frequency
Frequency is how often the waves go up and down. If you keep wiggling the jump rope up and down quickly, you create high-frequency waves. But if you do it slowly, you make low-frequency waves. So, frequency tells us how many waves pass by a certain point in one second.

High-frequency waves have short wavelengths, and low-frequency waves have long wavelengths. It's like when you listen to music: high notes have high-frequency waves, and low notes have low-frequency waves.

## Sound and How It Works
Now, let's talk about sound! Sound is a type of wave that travels through the air, and it's how we hear things.

When you talk, play music, or make any noise, you create sound waves. These waves are like tiny vibrations in the air. They move through the air and reach your ears. Inside your ears, there are special parts that can feel these vibrations and turn them into the sounds you hear.

The pitch of a sound, whether it's high or low, depends on the frequency of the sound waves. High-pitched sounds have high-frequency waves, and low-pitched sounds have low-frequency waves.

The loudness of a sound depends on how big the waves are. Bigger waves mean a louder sound, while smaller waves make a quieter sound.

So, when you're listening to your favorite music, you're actually hearing a combination of different sound waves with various frequencies and amplitudes (the size of the waves). All these waves mix together to create the songs and sounds you love.

Remember, waves are everywhere in nature, from the ocean to the air you breathe, and they help us understand how things like sound work!
