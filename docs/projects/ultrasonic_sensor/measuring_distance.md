## Calculating Distance using sound
To calculate distance using ultrasound waves, we can use the speed formula:

```py
Speed = Distance / Time
```
Speed is how fast something travels (in this case, the speed of sound).
Distance is how far an object is from the source of the sound.
Time is how long it takes for the sound to travel to the object and back.
When we know the speed of sound, which is approximately 343 meters per second (in dry air at 20°C or 68°F), and we measure the time it takes for an ultrasound wave to bounce off an object and return, we can rearrange the formula to calculate distance:

```python
Distance = (Speed x Time) / 2
```
Dividing by 2 is important because the sound wave travels to the object and then back, so we need to account for the round trip.

## How Bats "See" with Ultrasound:
* Bats are fascinating animals that use ultrasound to "see" in the dark. They emit high-pitched ultrasound waves, which are too high for our ears to hear. These waves bounce off objects, like insects or obstacles in their path, and return to the bat.

* Bats have specialized ears that can detect these returning echoes. By measuring the time it takes for the echoes to come back and the direction they come from, bats can create a mental map of their surroundings. They essentially create a picture of the world through sound, much like how we see with our eyes.

* This ability to use ultrasound for navigation and hunting is called echolocation, and it allows bats to fly and hunt in complete darkness, even in places with lots of obstacles.

In summary, the speed of sound can be used to calculate distance by measuring the time it takes for sound waves to travel to an object and back. Bats have evolved to use this principle to their advantage, emitting ultrasound waves and listening for the returning echoes to "see" and navigate their surroundings. It's a remarkable example of how animals have adapted to their environments and developed unique senses for survival.
