# Build a musical thermin

* A sound thermin is a device which plays sounds based on how far the object is from the instrument 
* In this project , we will be using an ultrasonic sensor to control the piezo buzzer to make a sound thermin


* Hints : Start with looking at the code for the piezo buzzer , remember how we used a potentiometer to send values to the buzzer, Next try to remember how we used the ultrasonic sensor to read distance values , all you need to code is to take values from the ultrasonic sensor as we just did and apply those values to the piezo buzzer to build your musical thermin.
