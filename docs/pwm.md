# Pulse width modulation

* Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is like a clever technique that makes a piezo buzzer play different musical notes by rapidly turning it on and off.

* Imagine you have a flashlight, but instead of giving a steady beam of light, you can make it flicker really fast. When you turn it on and off very quickly, it seems like it's glowing dimmer or brighter, even though it's just flickering. This is somewhat similar to what PWM does, but with electricity instead of light.

* Now, let's use PWM to make a piezo buzzer play music:

* ## Turning On and Off: 
Instead of giving the buzzer a continuous flow of electricity (like keeping the flashlight fully on), we turn the electricity on and off rapidly. This   on-off pattern happens very, very quickly, much faster than you can see or hear.

* ## Controlling the Notes: 
By changing how long we keep the electricity on (the "on" time) and how long we keep it off (the "off" time), we can control the buzzer's vibrations. Remember, the buzzer vibrates to make sound. When we change the on-off times in a certain way, we can make it play different musical notes.

* ## Making Tunes: 
To play a song, we create a specific pattern of on and off times for the buzzer. For example, a short "on" time followed by a short "off" time might make a high-pitched note, while a longer "on" time followed by a longer "off" time might make a lower-pitched note. By combining these patterns, we can make the buzzer play songs and melodies.

So, PWM is like a clever technique that tells the piezo buzzer when to vibrate and when to stop, very quickly, to create different musical notes. It's a smart way to make your buzzer sing songs without having to change the buzzer itself. Just like how the flickering flashlight tricks your eyes into thinking it's glowing differently, PWM tricks the buzzer into making different sounds!
