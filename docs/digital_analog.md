# Digital and analog values


When working with circuits and micro-controllers you can get two types of values digital values and analog values 

* Digital Values are like switches that can be either ON or OFF, like a light switch. Imagine you have a super cool robot. When you tell it to move, it can only understand two commands: "Go" or "Stop." There's no in-between. That's how digital things work. It's either one thing or the other, like a computer understanding "yes" or "no."

* Analog Values, on the other hand, are more like a dimmer switch for a light. Instead of just "On" or "Off," you can make the light any level of brightness in between. So, if you want the light to be just a little bit bright or really, really bright, you can do that. Analog values are like a range of options, not just two choices.

* To give you an example, think about a volume control on a music player:

    * Digital Volume: If it's digital, you might have just a few levels, like "Volume 1," "Volume 2," or "Volume 3." You can't make it a tiny bit louder than "Volume 1" or a little softer than "Volume 2." It jumps from one level to another.

    * Analog Volume: If it's analog, you can smoothly turn the knob to make the sound exactly as loud as you want. You can have it a tiny bit louder or a little bit softer, anywhere in between. It's like having a lot more choices and being able to find the perfect volume.

* So, in a nutshell, digital values are like having only a few options, while analog values give you a whole range of choices, just like switching a light on and off vs. dimming it to your preferred level.
